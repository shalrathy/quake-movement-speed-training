    <h2 id=speed_turning>Speed turning</h2>

    <p>Turning increases speed. Different turning angles increases speed differently. Walking
      straight have a speed of 320. By turning with the keyboard or mouse we can reach
      speeds up to 493. Pay attention to the "Speed angle plot" to see which turning angle
      give the most speed.</p>

    <p>The best view angle is the same whether moving forward and strafing to one side, or
      when only moving forward. But strafing makes jumping be more forward, this is useful
      for circle jumping.</p>

        <img src=plot_ground_forward_always_run_off.png width=640/></a>
      <figcaption>Heatmap showing how much speed is gained by looking left/right when
        moving at different speeds when running forward. Y-axis is traveling speed, x-axis
        is degrees looking left/right from the direction of movement, green colors indicate
        traveling speed and look degree increases speed, red colors indicate speed
        decreases.<br/>We can see that moving forward without looking left/right tops out at
        about 320. And if we look left/right at just the right angle we top out at slightly
        less than 500.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>To train speed turning you can look at the "speed angle now" plot
      (with <tt>scr_speed 3</tt>) while turning the mouse. Make a constant turning angle
      that keeps the "speed angle now" plot center at the peak speed increase. You can
      use <tt>scr_speed_angles 45</tt> to better see the speed peak in the "speed angle
      now" plot. Using <tt>host_framerate 0.005</tt> more clearly shows the best turning
      speed, but the timing is different so training with slowmo is unproductive. Speed
      turning is unlikely to be helpful in real Quake situations.</p>

    <h2 id=zigzagging>Zigzagging</h2>

    <p>Strafing left and right in quick succession increases speed up to 405.</p>

      <figcaption>Slowmo. The "Speed angle now" plot first shows speed increase up to
        320 by going forward.<br/>Then when strafing the "speed angle now" plot momentarily
        change shape the current view angle quickly goes past a peak of speed increase.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <video controls loop muted><source src=zigzag_slowmo.webm /></video>
      <figcaption>Slowmo. The "Speed angle now" plot show that we get a momentary
        increase in speed by strafing in one direction, and get another momentary increase in
        speed by strafing in the opposite direction, when the angle has gone past the speed
        increase peak.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>To train zigzagging just hit strafe keys as fast as possible. I do not think human
      reaction times will be fast enough to reduce speed.</p>
    
    <h2 id=wallhugging>Wallhugging</h2>

    <p>Going forward and strafing into a wall increases speed up to 465. Speed increase
      changes depending on your horizontal view angle.</p>

      <video controls loop muted><source src=wallhugging.webm /></video>
      <figcaption>Maximize speed by moving the horizontal view angle so the peak value in
        "speed angle now" is in the center of the plot.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>To train wallhugging walk against walls on the left and right and find the perfect
      viewing angle by looking at the "speed angle now" plot (with <tt>scr_speed
      3</tt>). You can use <tt>scr_speed_angles 45</tt> to better see the speed peak in
      the "speed angle now" plot.</p>
    
    <h2 id=circle_jumping>Circle-jumping</h2>

    <p>Circle jumping or strafe jumping is just speed turning and jumping to keep the
      increased speed while in the air. Like speed turning it can increase speed up to
      493. But the increased speed is kept while in the air, and while going a specific
      direction.</p>
    
    <p>Getting maximum speed increase of 493 requires turning about 270 degrees. Turning fewer
      degrees gets less speed but avoids looking backwards, which adds up to more forward
      speed overall.</p>
    
    <figure>
      <video controls loop muted><source src=circlejump_realtime.webm /></video>
      <figcaption>A turn of about 90 degrees giving a speed of 466.<br/>The "speed angle
        now" plot shows that the turning angle is near the peak speed increase for the
        turning part of the circle jump. <br/>The "speed angle jump" plot shows that the
        jump happened when the turning angle is near a peak, but it happens too fast to
        properly tell.</figcaption>
    </figure>

        plot shows that the jump happened when the turning angle is near a peak.<br/>This
        is more difficult for me than the real-time circle-jump because the slowmo
        turning timing is different.</figcaption>

    </figure>

    <p>To train circle-jumping you can split it up into two steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Do circle-jumps but focus on the "speed angle jump" plot (with <tt>scr_speed
          3</tt>) and ensure you jump when the view angle is close to the peak speed
          increase.</li>
        <li>Do circle-jumps but focus on consistent change in your view angle. Try
          different turning speeds to maximize <tt>maxspeed</tt> (with <tt>scr_speed
          1</tt>).</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p>Other tips:
      <ul>
        <li>Move forward a bit to get up to speed 320 before starting the turn into the circle-jump.</li>
        <li>Bind key to <tt>restart</tt> to quickly make many attempts from a consistent state.</li>
        <li>Do many circle-jumps right after each other to train circlejumping in
        different situations.</li>
        <li>Train circle-jumping turning both directions.</li>
        <li>A good circle-jump lets you jump directly to the gold key
          in <tt>e1m6</tt>. Training that jump also trains how to jump the furthest off a
          ledge.</li>
        <li>Circle jumping require many things happening very quickly and very
          precisely. The only way to train it is to build muscle memory.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2 id=bunny_hopping>Bunny hopping</h2>
    
    <p>Bunny hopping is continually jumping while speed turning in the air to gain
      speed. Bunny hopping can increase speed up to about 500 before friction from
      being on the ground between jumps reduces speed more than it can be increased in
      the air.</p>
    
    <p>Speed turning in the air is slightly vs on the ground has differences: The optimal
      view angle is different. The optimal view angle is not the same when only strafing
      vs. when moving forward and strafing. And the possible speed increase in the air is
      less than on the ground.</p>

    <p>A good approach to increasing speed in the air is to not move forward but only
      strafe in a direction. The view angle should continually turn towards the
      strafing direction. To move forward instead of jumping around in a circle you
      often change strafe direction and the view angle turning direction.</p>

    <figure>
      <video controls loop muted>
        <source src=bunnyhop_strafe_and_turn_netquake.webm /></video>
      <figcaption>Bunny-hopping by gaining speed the air using speed turning while only
        strafing. <br/>The "speed angle now" plot has tiny peaks of speed increase that
        quickly move away from the viewing angle. The small speed increases quickly adds
        up because there is no friction in the air. <br/>The "speed history" shows that we
        lose speed when landing, and when switching the strafe direction, and that we lose
        more speed the faster we are going. <br/>To get a high speed there are some wild
        turns which means the forward speed is also reduced. Switching strafing direction
        more often will reduce wild turning but requires more complex button
        mashing.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>

        <img src=plot_air_left_stand.png width=640/></a>
      <figcaption>Heatmap showing how much speed is gained by looking left/right when
        moving at different speeds in the air while strafing left. Y-axis is traveling
        speed, x-axis is degrees looking left/right from the direction of movement, green
        colors indicate traveling speed and look degree increases speed, red colors
        indicate speed decreases. <br/>The plot is shown one game tick after strafing
        left. <br/>We can see that we gain speed by turning slightly to the left, the
        faster traveling speed the narrowed the angle gets. When strafing right the plot
        is mirrored.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>Bunny hopping is different in QuakeWorld and
      Netquake/Dosquake/Winquake/GLquake/Regular quake/rq. In QuakeWorld there is no
      ground friction when bunny hopping. This difference means that bunny hopping in
      QuakeWorld does not require as precise speed turning to gain speed, and it means
      there is no limit to how much speed can be gained with bunny hopping.</p>

    <figure>
      <video controls loop muted>

        speed is 721 compared to the Netquake speed of 501.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>Training bunny hopping tips:
      <ul>
        <li>Pressing and holding jump while in the air will jump as soon as you land. So
          when bunny hopping you can release and press and hold the jump button at any point
          in the air. This means you do not have to jump exactly when you land.</li>
        <li>Train on a big open map like <tt>100m.bsp</tt>.</li>
        <li>Start bunny hopping from a stand-still. Bunny hopping gets more difficult the
          faster you move, so starting with speed 460 (from a good circle-jump) means you
          have to have perfect bunny hopping turning before increasing speed. If you
          instead start with speed 0 or speed 320 (from walking forward) you can more
          easily see when you are optimally turning the view angle.</li>
        <li>Look at the speed history plot (wih <tt>scr_speed 2</tt>) to see how much
          speed you are building. Show plot more clearly by increasing min y-value
          with <tt>scr_speed_minspeed 300</tt>, or reducing history length with
          <tt>scr_speed_history 30</tt>.</li>
        <li>Use <tt>scr_speed 12</tt> and look at the first umber to see how much speed
          you gain each jump from speed turning in the air.</li>
        <li>Start without changing strafing direction until you get a feel for optimally
          turning the view angle.</li>
        <li>Bunny hopping require many things happening very quickly and very
          precisely. The only way to train it is to build muscle memory.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2 id=power_bunny_hopping>Power bunny hopping</h2>

    <p>Power bunny hopping is bunny hopping but also briefly holding forward when landing
      to avoid loosing speed due to friction. Power bunny hopping can increase speeds to
      about 700. Ground friction is still a problem because the required view angle have
      to be so precise at high speeds.</p>

    <p>Power bunny hopping is not required for QuakeWorld. There is no ground friction so
      regular bunny hopping in QuakeWorld is faster than power bunny hopping in
      Netquake.</p>

    <p>Power bunny hopping is easier when "Always run" is off and run is always
      enabled. To ensure this is the case, run the commands <tt>cl_alwaysrun 0</tt>
      and <tt>+speed</tt>.</p>

    <p>Power bunny hopping is still speed turning. But speed turning is different in the
      air vs. on the ground, and we are only on the ground for one game tick. The optimal
      view angle when on the ground, and moving forward, and strafing, and moving above
      450 is turning slightly into the strafing direction. The optimal view angle when in
      the air, and not moving forward, and strafing is continually turning into the
      strafing direction. So power bunny hopping requires quickly and precisely switching
      between these two types of speed turning.</p>

    <p>The more speed you have the more ground friction reduces speed. This means that
      getting a single power bunny hop can take away all speed increases from several
      perfect speed power bunny hops. The faster you move the more friction reduces speed
      and the harder it is to hit good landings. This makes power bunny hopping difficult
      to use in general Quake situations.</p>

        little due to speed turning in the air. And that the speed increases a bit more
        when jumping up to 500.<br/> Max speed reached is 503.</figcaption>

        traveling speed, x-axis is degrees looking left/right from the direction of
        movement, green colors indicate traveling speed and look degree increases speed,
        red colors indicate speed decreases.<br/> The plot shows that looking slightly
        into the turning direction increases speed up to 500. And the higher the speed,
        the narrower the view angles that increase speed.

        run is on. The optimal view angle is now farther away from straight ahear and its
        the opposite direction to the strafing direction. This explains why it is more
        difficult to power bunny hop when always run is on.

    <p>Training power bunny hopping tips:
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a circle-jump. The view angle is pretty consistently straight
          forward above speed 450. But below this speed the view angle is further away from
          forward and having to learn multiple view angles is difficult.</li>
        <li>Train on a big open map like <tt>100m.bsp</tt>.</li>
        <li>Train while always holding forward down. This means speed turning in the air
          wont work. But its fewer keys to press so it partly builds muscle memory for
          some of the button mashing.</li>
        <li>Train without doing speed turning, to build muscle memory for the landing view
          angle.</li>
        <li>Slow down game with <tt>host_framerate 0.01</tt> to give yourself time to
          press all the required buttons. The different game speed messes up the muscle
          memory for view angle turning. So after building muscle memory for the
          complicated button mashing, expect having to retrain the view angle
          turning.</li>
        <li>Train by only attempting a power bunny hop every second jump. This reduces the
          button masking while building muscle memory. Look at the "Speed history" plot
          for big decrease in speed to check if you missed the landing view angle.</li>
        <li>Train by using <tt>sv_speedhelppower 1</tt> to visualize the best angle view
          on landing.</li>
        <li>Train with <tt>scr_speed 23</tt> to see where you can improve each jump. Look
          at first two characters to verify you are holding down forward and a strafe key
          on the landing frame. Look at the second number to see how much speed you
          lose/gain to ground friction on the landing frames. Look at the last number in
          the jump info to see how many degrees your view angle was away from giving the
          most speed on the landing frame.</li>
        <li>Bunny hopping require many things happening very quickly and very
          precisely. The only way to train it is to build muscle memory.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id=plots>Plots</h2>

    There are four speeds you can move forward:
    <ul>
      <li>Speed 0: Standing still. (<tt>cl_alwaysrun 0; -speed; -forward</tt>)</li>
      <li>Speed 200: Moving forward with always run off and running key disabled
        (<tt>cl_alwaysrun 0; -speed; +forward</tt>).</li>
      <li>Speed 400: Moving forward with always run off and the running enabled
        (<tt>cl_alwaysrun 0; +speed; +forward</tt>).</li>
      <li>Speed 800: Moving forward with always run on and running key enabled
        (<tt>cl_alwaysrun 1; +speed; +forward</tt>).</li>
    </ul>
    These different forward speeds changes the normalized vectors that ends up increasing
    speed by turning.

      <figcaption>Heatmap showing how much speed is gained by looking left/right when
        moving at different speeds on the ground. Y-axis is traveling speed, x-axis is
        degrees looking left/right from the direction of movement, green colors indicate
        traveling speed and look degree increases speed, red colors indicate speed
        decreases. <br />These plots show the speed increases for all speeds and strafing
        directions at the game tick you are on the ground when bunny hopping.<br/> Looking
        at all speed combinations we can see that strafing and moving forward with +speed
        and always run off have the speed increases closest to looking straight
        ahead.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Heatmap showing how much speed is gained by looking left/right when
        moving at different speeds in the air. Y-axis is traveling speed, x-axis is
        degrees looking left/right from the direction of movement, green colors indicate
        traveling speed and look degree increases speed, red colors indicate speed
        decreases. <br/>These plots show the speed increases for all speeds and strafing
        direction after one game tick of that movement. If the plots were on the same game
        tick the movement was triggered then the max speed increase would be straight
        ahead, that one game tick is not relevant for real gameplay. <br/> Looking at all
        speed combinations we can see that strafing and not moving forward have the speed
        increases closest to looking slightly to the strafing direction.</figcaption>

    <h2 id=tas>Tool assisted speed</h2>
    
    <p>TAS Quake uses different techniques that utilize joysticks and
      super precision to maximize speed while ensuring the recording is
      fun to watch.</p>

    <figure>
      <video controls loop muted>
        <source src=tas_100m_tasquake.dem.webm /></video>
      <figcaption>Best TAS 100m time
        using <a href="https://github.com/lipsanen/TASQuake">TASQuake</a>. <br/>Demos does
        not record key presses so the view angle calculation is missing. But the "Speed
        history" plot shows how much speed is possible.<br/>Max speed reached is 702 and
        the final time is 0:08.97.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We can also use tools to maximize speed but apply them to the normal movement speed
      techniques. These commands change the view angle to gain the most speed.</p>

    <p><ul>
        <li><tt>sv_speedhelppower 1</tt>: This helps with the power-part of power bunny
          hopping. It changes the view angle when landing to minimize speed lost due to
          ground friction.</li>
        <li><tt>sv_speedhelpbunny 1</tt>: This helps with bunny hopping. It changes the
          view angle when in the air to maximize speed gained from speed turning. This
          turns very fast which makes it difficult to move in a straight line. The
          solution is to change direction more often when in the air, but that requires
          retraining a lot of muscle memory. <tt>sv_speedhelpbunny 10</tt> changes the
          angle a maximum of +-10 degrees, this is a good value for going forward, because
          it does not turn too fast to handle. If going for maximum speed a good value is
          <tt>sv_speedhelpbunny 70</tt> so the view angle always jumps to the other side
          when changing strafing direction.</li>
        <li><tt>sv_speedhelpview 0</tt>: This stops updating the seen view angle, but
          changes the view angle just before the speed calculations are made. So speed is
          increased from helper commands but the view angle is not affected.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <figcaption>TAS 100m run that updates view angle. This is difficult to control
        because the tool turns too fast and makes it difficult to go in a straight
        line. <br/>Max speed reached is 648 but the final time is slow.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <video controls loop muted>
        <source src=tas_100m_update_wish.webm /></video>
      <figcaption>TAS 100m run that does not update view angle. Not updating the view
      angle means the air turning move sideways more than normally and thus does not go in
      a straight line. <br/>Max speed reached is still 648 and the final time is still
      slow at 0:10.75.</figcaption>
